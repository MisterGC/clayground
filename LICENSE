Important Note on Qt6 Dependency:

This project depends on the Qt framework, which is not included
and must be installed separately.

Depending on the Qt license you use (commercial, LGPL, or GPL), different obligations may
apply when building and distributing software based on this project:

- If you use a **commercial Qt license**, you are subject to the terms of your
  commercial agreement with The Qt Company.
- If you use the **Open Source Qt version**:
  - You must review which Clayground components you are using.
  - If you only use components depending on **LGPL-licensed** Qt modules, you must
    comply with LGPL requirements (e.g., dynamic linking, providing notices, allowing relinking).
  - If you use components depending on **GPL-licensed** Qt modules, your project as a whole
    becomes subject to the GPL, and any resulting binaries must comply with the GPL license
    terms (e.g., source code disclosure).

Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with the appropriate Qt license.

This project itself does not include Qt or any Qt source code and does not impose any Qt license obligations beyond 
those already applicable to users by their choice of Qt installation.
