## Rapid Game Development with Live-Reloading

Clayground is a [Qt](https://www.qt.io)-based toolset that combines C++, JavaScript, and [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-index.html) for rapid game development in a sandbox environment with live-reloading capabilities. Born from game jam experiences, it's designed to reduce build times and accelerate the creative process.

## Design Philosophy

- **Rapid Prototyping First**: Optimize for quick iteration and experimentation
- **Code-Centric**: Focus on writing code, not clicking through tools
- **Leverage Qt**: Build on Qt's powerful foundation instead of reinventing
- **Open and Extensible**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend

## Who Is This For?

- **Game Jammers**: Rapid prototyping with instant feedback
- **Indie Developers**: Build small to medium games efficiently  
- **Learners**: Explore game development with immediate results
- **Qt Developers**: Use familiar tools for game creation
